I'm following the code in "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" by Peter Shirley. I'm doing this in Python rather than the
recommended C++. Knowing that there are more elegant solutions, I going to start by doing a direct port to Python, and
benchmarking the results. Once I get it working, I'll try some optimizations like using numpy or multiprocessing.
